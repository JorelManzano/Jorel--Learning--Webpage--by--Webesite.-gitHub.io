          <li>Explain why the keyboard must be declared in the website?
          <li>Explain what the "title changes?"
          <li>Can you add an image to the browser-tab?
            <li>If yes ... how is this done?
          <li>What does changing the keywords do for index-based searches
            Changing or modifying the keywords in index-based searches helps to refine the search results and make them more precise. 
            Index-based searches rely on an index of words and phrases within a document or web page, and by modifying the keywords, we can be more specific about what we're looking for.
             For example, if we search for "dogs," we may get a lot of results about all kinds of dogs, but if we modify our search to "German Shepherd dogs," we'll get results that are more closely related to what we're looking for.
              This can save us time and help us find the information we need more quickly and easily.
